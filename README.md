### Description

This bot provides a text bridge between an IRC channel and a Mumble server.

### How to install/configure/run

You can directly run sftbot by typing `./run` or `python3 -m sftbot`.
To permanently install sftbot, type `sudo ./setup.py install`. Then, you can run it by typing `sftbot`.

You need to provide a config file that (among others) contains user credentials for the bot. An example conf file can be found in `sftbot.conf.example`.

You can either specify a conf file path as a command line argument (`sftbot myconffile.conf`), or place it at `./sftbot.conf` or `/etc/sftbot.conf`.

### Behaviour

By default, the bot

- Relays messages from a mumble channel to an IRC channel
- Leaves the channel when somebody types 'gtfo'
- Tries to reconnect on connection failures

However, this behaviour can be altered easily by editing `sftbot/__main__.py`, which contains several fairly self-explainatory callback functions that will be automatically invoked at the appropriate times.
For example, certain IRC messages may be ignored by adding a line `if message.contains('bannedtext'): return` to the top of `ircTextMessageCallback`.
More complex, 'botty' behaviour may be implemented the same way; note that you can call `irc.sendTextMessage()` and `mumble.sendTextMessage()` from everywhere within the callback functions.

### Dependencies

- python3
- protobuf-python (Debian/Ubuntu package: python-protobuf, Arch package: python-protobuf)

### TODOs

Nice-to-have features (which we don't plan to implement right now, but feel free to do it yourself):

- SSL certificate validation support
- More chat protocols (e.g. XMPP multi-user chat)
- Init scripts for `<your distribution here>`

### Misc

Mumble uses Google Protobuf for most of its communications; this means that one code file needs to be auto-generated (that's what the `Makefile` is there for).

### Contact

You can find us at `irc.freenode.net/#sfttech`. If you found a bug, feel free to join and randomly insult channel OPs until someone fixes it (or bans you).
Alternatively, fix it yourself and send a pull request.
